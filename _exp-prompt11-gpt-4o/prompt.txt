Modify the code to be exactly {prob*100}% different. Your changes should enhance 
the algorithm's runtime efficiency without altering its main functionality. 
Focus on practical performance improvements, such as reducing redundant 
calculations, restructuring loops, or replacing expensive operations. Please 
confirm the difference is exactly {prob*100}%.
