Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n\nThe optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and also give it a one-line description with the main idea.\n\nProvide the Python code and a one-line description with the main idea (without enters). Give the response in the format:\n# Description: <short-description>\n# Code: \n# ```python\n# <code>\n# ```\n# "}
