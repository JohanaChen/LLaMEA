# One-line description: "Dynamic Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Sampling"
# This algorithm uses adaptive sampling to select the next individual based on the fitness and the dimension,
# and ensures the fitness stays within the bounds to prevent overfitting.

# Example usage:
# ```python
# dynamic_adaptive_genetic_algorithm = DynamicAdaptiveGeneticAlgorithm(budget=100, dim=10)
# func = lambda x: x**2
# best_individual = dynamic_adaptive_genetic_algorithm(func)
# print(best_individual)
