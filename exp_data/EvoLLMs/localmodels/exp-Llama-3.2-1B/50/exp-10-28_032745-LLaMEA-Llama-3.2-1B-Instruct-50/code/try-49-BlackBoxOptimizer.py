# Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm for Black Box Optimization
# 
# This algorithm uses a novel search strategy that combines line search and gradient descent to refine the individual lines of the search space.
# The algorithm starts with a random initial guess and iteratively applies a line search to find the optimal individual line.
# The line search is combined with gradient descent to update the individual line based on the gradient of the black box function.
# The algorithm uses a population of individuals to avoid local optima and converges to the global optimum.
