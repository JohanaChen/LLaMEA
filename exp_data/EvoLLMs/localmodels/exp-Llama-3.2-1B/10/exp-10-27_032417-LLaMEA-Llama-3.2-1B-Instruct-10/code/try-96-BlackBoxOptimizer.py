# Description: Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm for Black Box Optimization
# Code: 
# ```python
# Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm for Black Box Optimization
# 
# This algorithm combines genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to find the optimal solution.
# The algorithm iterates over the range of possible solutions, generating new lines of code to refine the solution.
# The probability of accepting the current solution is calculated based on the number of function evaluations used.
# The algorithm terminates when the number of function evaluations reaches the budget.
# 
# Parameters:
# - budget (int): The maximum number of function evaluations allowed.
# - dim (int): The dimensionality of the search space.
# 
# Returns:
# - solution (float): The optimal solution.
# - num_evaluations (int): The number of function evaluations used.
