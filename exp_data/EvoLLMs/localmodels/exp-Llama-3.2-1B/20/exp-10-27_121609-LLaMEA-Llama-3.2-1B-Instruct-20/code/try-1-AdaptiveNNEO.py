# Code Explanation:
# AdaptiveNNEO is a novel metaheuristic algorithm that combines exploration-exploitation and adaptive line search to optimize black box functions.
# It initializes a population of random individuals, evaluates each individual using the provided function, and then iteratively applies adaptive line search to refine the strategy.
# The algorithm decreases the exploration rate over time, which allows it to adapt to the changing environment and improve its performance.
# The adaptive line search is based on the function's derivative, which provides a more accurate estimate of the function's behavior near its minimum.
# The algorithm evaluates a maximum of `budget` function evaluations per individual, which can be adjusted based on the specific problem.
# The population size can be adjusted based on the problem's requirements.
# The algorithm uses a simple line search strategy, which may not be optimal for all problems, but can provide a good starting point for more complex problems.
# The adaptive line search is a key component of this algorithm, as it allows it to adapt to the changing environment and improve its performance over time.
# The algorithm can be further optimized by incorporating additional heuristics, such as knowledge-based reasoning or machine learning techniques.
