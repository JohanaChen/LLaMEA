Modify the optimization algorithm code to improve its performance in terms of 
convergence speed. The modification should result in a code difference of 
exactly {prob*100}%. Ensure that the changes are meaningful to enhance 
optimization speed without focusing on code efficiency or readability 
improvements. Explore any strategy within the algorithm to achieve this, 
but keep the difference precisely at the specified percentage.
