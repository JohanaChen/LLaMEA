Please enhance the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm given below 
by modifying it. The modifications should introduce a code difference of 
precisely {prob*100}% compared to the original code. Focus on optimizing the 
algorithm's behavior rather than its implementation efficiency. You are free to 
explore any area of the algorithm's logic, but ensure that the total code 
difference remains exactly at {prob*100}% and is geared toward faster convergence.
