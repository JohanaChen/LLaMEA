Create an improved variant of this optimization algorithm that has exactly 
{prob*100}% difference in code. Focus on practical performance enhancements, 
such as optimizing loops, restructuring inefficient parts, or removing redundant 
steps. List each change with a brief explanation, and verify that the difference 
meets the exact {prob*100}% target.
