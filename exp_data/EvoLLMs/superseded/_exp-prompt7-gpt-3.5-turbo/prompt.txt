Please adjust the code so that it is exactly {prob*100}% different, aiming for 
a performance boost without changing the core functionality. Suggested 
improvements could include optimizing data structures, simplifying control 
flow, or consolidating repeated operations. When done, confirm that the 
difference is {prob*100}%.
