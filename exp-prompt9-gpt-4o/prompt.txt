Please modify the code so that the difference between the original and modified 
versions is exactly {prob*100}%. Aim to improve the algorithm's efficiency by 
making adjustments that optimize its performance, such as by refining the 
mathematical functions, streamlining logic, or adjusting parameters. Ensure the 
functionality remains essentially the same, with the focus on achieving the 
exact {prob*100}% code difference.
