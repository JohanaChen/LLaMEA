Here's a piece of code for an optimization algorithm. Please modify it by 
exactly {prob*100}% to improve the algorithm's performance in terms of 
optimization convergence speed. Focus on introducing meaningful changes that 
can potentially enhance its effectiveness, such as exploring alternative 
strategies or approaches across any aspect of the algorithm. Keep the 
modifications strictly within the specified {prob*100}% range for code 
difference while striving for faster convergence.
