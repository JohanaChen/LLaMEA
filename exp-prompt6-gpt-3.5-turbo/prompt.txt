I need you to modify the code to create a performance-improved variant. Please 
make sure the new code is exactly {prob*100}% different from the original. Focus
on enhancing efficiency, like reducing the complexity of loops, streamlining 
calculations, or removing redundant operations. Please use comments to 
highlight any significant changes you make and confirm that the difference is 
exactly {prob*100}%.
