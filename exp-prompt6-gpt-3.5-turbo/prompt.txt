Adjust the code such that the algorithm's convergence speed is improved, while 
ensuring that the changes result in an exact difference of {prob*100}% compared 
to the original code. This difference should reflect the modification in 
functionality, not code style or syntax. Feel free to adjust any part of the 
algorithm (e.g., initialization, selection, mutation, or other components) to 
achieve faster convergence while maintaining the specified code difference.
