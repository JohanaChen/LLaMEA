# One-line description: "Dynamic Adapative Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Sampling and Probability-based Refining"
# This algorithm uses adaptive sampling to select the next individual based on the fitness and the dimension,
# and ensures the fitness stays within the bounds to prevent overfitting using probability-based refining.
