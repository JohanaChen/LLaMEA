# Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm for Black Box Optimization using Evolutionary Strategies
# 
# This algorithm uses a combination of tournament selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population.
# The search space is divided into smaller sub-spaces, and each individual is evaluated at multiple points.
# The best individual is selected based on the fitness of its offspring, and the process is repeated for a specified number of generations.
