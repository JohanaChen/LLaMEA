# One-line description with the main idea
# Evolutionary Algorithm for Black Box Optimization using Genetic Programming with Refining Strategy
# This algorithm uses a population-based approach to optimize black box functions, with a refining strategy that refines the solution based on the current fitness.
# The algorithm uses a mutation operator to introduce randomness and adaptability, and evaluates the fitness of each individual using the current budget.
# The algorithm can be fine-tuned using a refining strategy, which can be adjusted to improve the optimization process.
