# One-line description: "Dynamic Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Sampling and Refinement"
# This algorithm uses adaptive sampling to select the next individual based on the fitness and the dimension,
# and ensures the fitness stays within the bounds to prevent overfitting, and refines the strategy based on the fitness and the dimension.
