# One-line description with the main idea
# Novel metaheuristic algorithm for black box optimization using a novel search strategy
# 
# The algorithm uses a combination of elitism and mutation to refine the population, 
# with a probability of 0.45 to select parents using tournament selection, 
# and a probability of 0.55 to create new offspring using crossover and mutation.
