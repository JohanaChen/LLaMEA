# Novel metaheuristic algorithm for black box optimization using a novel search strategy
# 
# 1.  Initialize a population of random individuals using the given search space.
# 2.  Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
# 3.  Select the fittest individuals to reproduce.
# 4.  Create a new generation by crossover and mutation of the selected individuals.
# 5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations.
# 6.  Return the final population and their fitness values.
# 
# 1.  To refine the strategy, we can introduce a probability of changing the individual's direction.
# 2.  This can be achieved by adding a random number between 0 and 1 to the direction of the individual.
# 3.  We can also introduce a mutation rate, which is the probability of changing an individual's value.
# 4.  We can use a simple mutation strategy, such as adding a random value to the individual's value.
# 5.  We can also use a more sophisticated mutation strategy, such as using a neural network to predict the mutation probability.
# 
# 1.  To improve the algorithm's performance, we can use a more efficient search strategy, such as using a genetic algorithm or a particle swarm optimization algorithm.
# 2.  We can also use a more advanced optimization technique, such as using a gradient-based optimization algorithm or a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm.
# 
# 1.  To handle the high dimensionality of the problem, we can use a more advanced optimization technique, such as using a hierarchical optimization algorithm or a multi-objective optimization algorithm.
# 2.  We can also use a more efficient search strategy, such as using a grid search or a random search.
# 
# 1.  To handle the large number of function evaluations, we can use a more efficient search strategy, such as using a parallel search or a distributed search.
# 2.  We can also use a more advanced optimization technique, such as using a distributed optimization algorithm or a parallel optimization algorithm.
