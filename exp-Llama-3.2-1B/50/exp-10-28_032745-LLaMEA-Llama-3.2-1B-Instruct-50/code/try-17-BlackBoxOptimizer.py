# Novel metaheuristic algorithm for black box optimization using a novel search strategy
# 
# The algorithm uses a combination of the following heuristics:
# 1.  The "probability of improvement" strategy: The algorithm changes the individual's strategy to refine its strategy based on the probability of improvement.
# 2.  The "line search" strategy: The algorithm uses a line search to find the optimal point in the search space.
# 3.  The "random restart" strategy: The algorithm restarts the search process with a new initial guess.
# 4.  The "exploration-exploitation trade-off" strategy: The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation to find the optimal solution.

# Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm for Black Box Optimization
# 
# The algorithm works as follows:
# 1.  Initialize the search space and the budget.
# 2.  For each iteration, evaluate the fitness of the current individual.
# 3.  If the budget is exceeded, break the loop.
# 4.  Update the individual using the "probability of improvement" strategy.
# 5.  If the updated individual has a better fitness, return it.
# 6.  If the updated individual has the same fitness as the current individual, restart the search process with a new initial guess.
# 7.  If the updated individual has a worse fitness, return the current individual.
# 8.  If the budget is exceeded, return the current individual.

# Example usage:
optimizer = BlackBoxOptimizer(100, 10)
initial_guess = np.array([-5.0, -5.0])
best_individual, best_fitness = optimizer(initial_guess)
print("Best individual:", best_individual)
print("Best fitness:", best_fitness)
