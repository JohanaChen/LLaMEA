Now, refine the strategy of the selected solution to improve it. Make sure you 
only change {prob*100}% of the code, which means if the code has 100 lines, you 
can only change {prob*100} lines, and the rest lines should remain the same. For 
this code, it has {num_lines} lines, so you can only change {int(prob*num_lines)}
lines, the rest {num_lines-int(prob*num_lines)} lines should remain the same. 
This changing rate {prob*100}% is the mandatory requirement, you cannot change 
more or less than this rate.
