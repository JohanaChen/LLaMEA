# One-line description with main idea
# HGEO: Hypergrid Genetic Optimization Engine

# Description: HGEO is a novel metaheuristic algorithm for black box optimization problems.
# HGEO uses a grid-based search strategy to explore the search space and a hypergrid-based optimization approach to refine the search.
# The algorithm evaluates the function at each hypergrid location and perturbation, and updates the hypergrid and its budget to explore new regions of the search space.
# The probability of convergence is set to 0.23636363636363636.
# The current budget is used to determine the number of hypergrid evaluations to perform.
# The algorithm uses a population-based approach to update the current solution.
# The selected solution is updated based on the probability of convergence.
# The code can be used to solve a wide range of optimization tasks, including those evaluated on the BBOB test suite.
# The algorithm is particularly effective for problems with a high dimensionality and a large search space.
# The selected solution to update is: HGEO: Hypergrid Genetic Optimization Engine
